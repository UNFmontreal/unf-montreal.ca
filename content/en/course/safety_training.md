### About the course

Training in safety measures to be followed in an environment with a high magnetic field is mandatory for all UNF members (i.e., operators, technical staff, researchers, graduate and post-doctoral students, and research assistants) and personnel associated with the IUGM, as well as for any other person who is, or may be, required to visit the UNF site. This training is provided by UNF officials, and includes:

- Basic concepts of magnetic fields
- Safety concepts to follow in an MRI room
- Safety Basics (COVID-19)
- Video clips on safety measures to follow in an MRI room
- UNF Tour
- Screening form for risk factors associated with high magnetic field exposure
- Question period
