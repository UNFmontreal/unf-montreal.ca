## Medical Emergency Protocol

* In the event of an emergency in the medical unit at UNF, call 5555.
* Identify:
      * What is the emergency
      * Where is the emergency
      * Who you are
* Security will follow the protocol determined by the hospital in such
    such situations.
* Typically, the nurse coordinator and the head of mechanical operations will initially respond.
* Once the situation is identified and confirmed, emergency measures will be followed as determined by the hospital and the procedures manual.
* Within the UNF compound, exceptional precautions may be taken taking into account the high magnetic field, as hospital personnel are not familiar with emergency procedures in an imaging unit.

     1. Evacuate the MRI room and close the doors.  
        This will prevent anyone who is not warned of the danger from entering the room.
     2. Evacuate the UNF area.  
        Participants, visitors, and staff should leave the area to an area not affected by the emergency.
     3. Assist emergency personnel.  
        Depending on the type of emergency, be available to assist as needed.
     4. Direct emergency responders to the necessary area:
        The UNF team knows the UNF area better than the emergency responder, be available to assist as needed.

**Medical equipment is in the cabinet in the participant preparation area. **

**The pharmacy can provide medication as needed.**
