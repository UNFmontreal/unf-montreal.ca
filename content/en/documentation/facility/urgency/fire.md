# Fire protocol

- *In the event of a fire in the UNF area, the in-house response team follows the appropriate protocol for the situation as determined by the hospital. *

- *Once the situation is identified and confirmed, emergency procedures will be followed as determined by the hospital and the procedures manual. *

- *Within the UNF facility, exceptional precautions may be taken to account for the high magnetic field, as hospital personnel are not familiar with emergency procedures in an imaging unit. *

1\. Evacuate the MRI room and close the doors:

This will prevent anyone who is not warned of the danger of a high magnetic field from entering the room.

2\. Evacuate the UNF area.

Participants, visitors, and staff should leave the area and move to an area not affected by the emergency.

3\. Assist emergency personnel:

Depending on the type of emergency, be available to assist as needed.

4\. Direct emergency responders to the needed area:

The UNF team knows the UNF area better than the emergency responder, be available to assist as needed.
