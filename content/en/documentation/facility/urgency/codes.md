## Emergency Codes

* In the event of an emergency at the hospital or research facility, the responsible security officer will announce the appropriate emergency code.

* The internal emergency team will act according to the appropriate protocol for the situation, as determined by the hospital.

* Once the situation is identified and confirmed, emergency measures will be taken according to procedures determined by hospital guidelines.

Once the situation has been identified and confirmed, emergency measures will be taken according to procedures determined by the hospital's guidelines. **Within the UNF facility, exceptional precautions may be taken due to the high magnetic field, as hospital personnel are not familiar with emergency procedures in an imaging unit.
