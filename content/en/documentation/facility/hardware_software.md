UNF provides hardware and software to researchers.
Some equipment must be reserved through the reservation protocol of the various UNF facilities in order to use it.


If a researcher wishes to use personal material he/she should send an email to the following [__address__](mailto:support.unf@criugm.qc.ca).


## Responsibilities and agreements
