The Neurotheque, affiliated with the Functional Neuroimaging Unit (UNF) installed at the University Institute of Geriatrics of Montreal ([IUGM](https://iugm.ca/)), is a data acquisition platform dedicated to electrophysiology and particularly to wireless electroencephalography (EEG). Our center has all the necessary equipment for setting up EEG acquisitions during various cognitive tasks and offers the possibility to use a VR headset simultaneously with the EEG. The Neurothèque thus allows data acquisition during naturalistic paradigms (video games, movies, social interactions), as well as more classic neuropsychological tasks.

Our team is also committed to providing you with technical support and training services for the setup, acquisition, and analysis of your data.

## Access

The Neurothèque is located in room RS078, in the basement of IUGM.
