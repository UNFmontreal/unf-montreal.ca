You **_must_** have valid ethical approval to perform acquisitions, make reservations on the MRI schedule, or to even begin recruiting participants for your study.

Since the implementation of the Nagano platform on April 1, 2021, all requests for evaluation of a research project at the CCSMTL must now be submitted by the [__Nagano platform__](https://ccsmtl.nagano.ca/login).
We invite you to read the information related to the Office for the Evaluation of Research Projects by following this [__link__](https://ccsmtl-mission-universitaire.ca/fr/ethique-recherche/bureau-devaluation-des-projets-de-recherche)

Imaging projects carried out at the CRIUGM at the Functional Neuroimaging Unit (UNF) will be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee â€“ Aging and Neuroimaging (CER VN) (https://ccsmtl-mission-universitaire.ca/fr/cer-vieillissement-et-neuroimagerie).
If you need additional information, do not hesitate to contact [__Mrs. Karima Bekhiti__](mailto:karima.bekhiticcsmtl@ssss.gouv.qc.ca)
