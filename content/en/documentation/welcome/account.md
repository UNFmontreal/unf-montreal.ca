To be able to carry out your study at the UNF, you must obtain a user account. This account will allow you to make a reservation (MRI, simulation room or test room) using the reservation calendar __[calendrier de r√©servation](https://reservation.unf-montreal.ca/Web/dashboard.php)__ and will give you access to the calculation servers.

We also encourage you to request to be added to the __[UNF slack](https://mic-unf.slack.com/)__. This is a chat where everyone can ask questions and help each other.

To get your account, send an email to the following address __[support.unf](mailto:support.unf@criugm.qc.ca?subject=Inscription-Serveurs_UNF)__.

Please also include the following information:

* Your full name, address and daytime telephone number.

* Your email address (the one that will be used for booking confirmation)

* The full name, address and telephone number of the principal investigator of the research project (if different from 1.)

The reservation system generates emails sent automatically. To prevent them from ending up in your spam folder, be sure to add the address reservationunf@criugm.qc.ca to the list of your approved senders.
