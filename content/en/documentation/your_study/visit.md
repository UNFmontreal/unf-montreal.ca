It is helpful to have a checklist to reduce the risk of error on acquisition day. All of the previous sections cover what is important to know, but it is easy to forget.

## Upon arrival

1. Have all required forms completed and signed
2. Ask your participant to wait in the waiting room while you:
     * Pick up a uniform
     * Give the forms to an available UNF staff member
     * Prepare MRI compatible lenses if needed
3. A UNF staff member will come to the waiting room to review the MRI screening form with your participant as soon as they are available.
4. When the team before you is finished and has cleared the MRI room as well as the control room, you will be asked to go and prepare materials for your study if needed.

## Travel

## Distancing

## Protection

**At least one member of the research team must be present during the acquisition session to respond to the needs and requests of their participants, and to assist UNF staff in case of emergency.
**In the event that the participant is a member of the research team (e.g., for a pilot), it is necessary that an additional member of the research team be present during the acquisition session.**

### Access card to enter the UNF

To enter the UNF, you must have an access card. In order to get an access card you need to send an email to this [__address__](mailto:support.unf@criugm.qc.ca). A $20 deposit is required to obtain a card. In addition, you must have completed the [MRI safety training](http://www.unf-montreal.ca/en/course/safety_training) before you can obtain your card.
