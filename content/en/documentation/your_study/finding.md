  Protocol following an incidental finding
type: "docs"
---

If a region with unusual features is identified in an image, UNF has established a procedure to follow in cases of incidental findings.

If a region of interest is noted during an MRI session, the images can be forwarded to a radiologist for a summary report. This report indicates whether further follow-up is indicated but **does not** constitute a clinical report.
