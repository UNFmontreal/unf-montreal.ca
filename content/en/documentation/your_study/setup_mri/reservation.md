To reserve the MRI scanner, you must have a __[reservation account](https://unf-montreal.ca/en/documentation/welcome/account)__, once you have obtained your account, you can submit reservation requests via the __[web calendar](https://reservation.unf-montreal.ca/Web/index.php?redirect=%2FWeb%2Fschedule.php%3F)__.

The __[reservation](http://www.unf-montreal.ca/en/documentation/facility/reservation/)__ section shows you step by step how to reserve the MRI scanner.

## Reminders: reservation rules
MRI reservations are subject to the following rules:

* Reservations must be for a minimum of 30 minutes
* Reservations increase in 15 minute increments
* MRI and control room set-up and clean-up time must be taken into consideration when booking time slots.
* Reservations must be made according to the UNF Hours of Operation (i.e. Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.).
* It is possible to book the MRI outside of these times. The following conditions apply:
  * Increased hourly rate (see the __[hourly rates and billing policies](http://www.unf-montreal.ca/en/rate)__ on the UNF website).
* Between research groups, a 15-minute time slot will be reserved on the UNF calendar to ensure that staff and researchers have time to go through their post-analysis disinfection list.
* If you wish to make a cancellation, please see the __[cancellation policy](http://www.unf-montreal.ca/en/rate)__ to avoid unnecessary costs.
