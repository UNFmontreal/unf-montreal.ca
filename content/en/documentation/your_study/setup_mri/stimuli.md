# Preparation and presentation of stimuli

This section is intended for students or research staff whose protocol includes a functional MRI portion for which experimental stimuli must be presented.


## Preparation of stimuli

For the preparation of your experiment, it is important to take into consideration what equipment is available at the UNF. Contact the [UNF technical coordinator](mailto:support.unf@criugm.qc.ca) for any question related to the use of material for presentation of stimuli, collection of behavioral data or physiological recording.

Each new project will receive a **MINIMUM one free hour** to run a pilot acquisition to verify that all systems are working properly. Imaging data should also be verified.

## Responsibilities regarding the use of equipment

UNF staff are responsible for the operation and preparation of the MRI scanner for each imaging session.

Users, i.e. researchers, research assistants or students, are responsible for setting up, testing, operating and returning the equipment to its place at the end of the acquisition session. This concerns all the equipment necessary for their experiment, both in the MRI room and in the control room. UNF personnel are available for technical assistance with UNF-owned equipment when needed, but users must be able to use it independently. User responsibilities include:

- The preparation, installation and verification of the equipment required in the MRI room for each imaging session. This must be done before the installation of the participant registered in the research project.

- The connection of all pieces of equipment required for the presentation of stimuli, the recording of physiological data or the collection of behavioral data.

- Starting stimulus programs (e.g. E-Prime task).

- Backup of all behavioral data and physiological records.
